        <p>Wearable Technology for Medicine</p>
        </div>




    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Data Sciences allow researchers to analyse and find patterns through extremely large data sets. Each day the human body produces two terabytes of data. Technology such as wearables
    can track and monitor data such as heart rate, sleep patterns, blood glucose, stress and even brain activity. Because of computer science, even small changes in these can be detected which can 
    help recognise or prevent any disorders early on.
    </p>


    <h2>Main Benefits of wearables</h2>
    <p>-Real time monitoring of vital statistics, providing more data for analysis
       -Earlier detection of disease or risk to health
       -Instant feedback of any risks with biometric readings
       -Convenience: they can fit into everyday life. Making it easier to track health than booking doctors appointments for vitals.
    </p>

    <h2>Emerging technology for wearables</h2>
    <p>Companies such as <a href="https://www.avawomen.com/">Ava</a>, <a href="https://www.mymotiv.com/">Motiv</a> and <a href="https://store.kardia.com/products/kardiamobile">KardiaMobile</a> are using wearables to track and help users understand data about many things from workouts with visual feedback to menstrual cycles.

    Although the most common form of wearable is watches, they can range from night only wearables to rings and more depending on the user's preference.
    </p>

    <h3>Heart disease detection</h3>
    <p>Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the US. Researchers have developed a biosensor that can be integrated into smartwatches or other wrist wearables.
    By using artificial intelligence, the biosensor would be able to predict early causes that could have gone undiagnosed until fatal. This is a major advantage for
    wearables and can be applied to many health risks, not just heart disease, in order to save lives.
    </p>

    <h2>Statistics on wearables</h2>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paullamkin/2018/10/23/smart-wearables-market-to-double-by-2022-27-billion-industry-forecast/?sh=71450eea2656">smart wearables</a> industry is expected to double by 2022 with 233 million unit sales, becoming a $27 billion+ industry. Fitbit's active users alone has gone 
    from 560,000 to 31 million between 2012 and 2020.

    <h2>The Dark side of wearables</h2>
    <p>Although there are many advantages to wearables with monitoring health and potentially saving lives, nothing comes without its drawbacks.</p>
        <h3>Privacy</h3>
        <p>Wearables have only vauge privacy policies. They can not sell data but it can be shared with 3rd parties or business partners. This could create privacy issues or concerns</p>
        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>Wearable devices can lead to confidential location data being discovered. This can create a dangerous security risk. The U.S. Department of Defence
        even banned the use of wearables when heading to warzones or overseas military bases.</p>
        <h3>Health</h3>
        <p>The WHO's panel on smartphone safety revealed research showing wearables could be carcinogenic. Experts believe wearables could pose serious health issues in the long run. 
        However it is also said more research is needed on this topic.</p>
