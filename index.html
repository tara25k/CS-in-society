        <h1 id='bodyTitle'>Why Were Computers Created?</h1>
        <p>Long before computers were created, the concept of maximising efficiency and using machines to benefit humankind had existed.</p>
        <p>Many early examples of such things include:</p>
        <ul id='bodyList'>
            <li>Babbage's analytical engine</li>
            <li>Logic Machines</li>
            <li>The ENIAC Machine</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/31/172531-050-E009D42C/portion-Charles-Babbage-Analytical-Engine-death-mill-1871.jpg" width='294px' height='244.5px'>
        <p>The one thing these all have in common is that they were originally created to carry out small calculations to speed up and maximise what humans couldn't. We have evolved from this concept in enourmous ways and global communication, endless information artificial intelligence are right at our fingertips</p>
        <p>Many would say that this has opened the door to so many newer inventions and so much good that society has much more benefited from the invention of computers. A small few of these arguments are presented in the pages below. However, it is also important to explore the counter argument, the idea that computers have actually done more harm to everyone than good.</p>
